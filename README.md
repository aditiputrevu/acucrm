### 🧑‍💻 Database Credentials
The app connects to the database using these parameters:
- **Host**: Set to `localhost`. You can change this if you're working with a remote database server.
- **User**: Enter your actual MySQL username when prompted.
- **Password**: Keep your MySQL password safe and secure.

3. Set up the MySQL database by importing the `AcuCRM.sql` file (this is the fun!).
4. Run the application: `python acucrm.py`.
